Arduino projects

Hi, these projects are either .ino files in folders of the same name to load into the Arduino IDE, or .Zip files 
that contain Microsoft Visual Studio solutions. 

You can download Visual Studio from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ or open the solutions in any version from VS 2015 onwards. You will need an Arduino IDE which will allow you to perform full debugging from your board. One such item is https://www.visualmicro.com/ which is Free for 90 days. Another is https://maker.pro/arduino/tutorial/how-to-use-visual-studio-for-arduino-development which is avilable as a NuGet package.
